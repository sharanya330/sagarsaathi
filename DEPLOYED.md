## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **ngrok Link**: The public URL (https://3fc0bd635ecd.ngrok-free.app) is temporary
   - It will stop working if you close the terminal or stop ngrok
   - To keep it running, leave the terminal open

2. **Docker**: Containers will restart automatically unless you stop them

3. **Database**: MongoDB data is persisted in a Docker volume (survives restarts)

4. **Environment**: Currently using development JWT secrets (change for production)

---

```bash
# Stop ngrok
pkill ngrok

# Stop Docker containers
export PATH="/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin:$PATH"
docker compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml down
```
